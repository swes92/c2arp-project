# C²ARP: Conflict & Crisis Analysis and Risk Prediction

**Putting the OS back into OSINT**

C²ARP is an open-source framework designed to provide transparent and actionable insights into global conflicts and crises. By leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT), the project aims to equip decision-makers with tools to navigate uncertainty and manage risks effectively.

## Vision
To establish a digital framework where decision-makers, regardless of size or resources, can access transparent and actionable insights derived from open-source intelligence, empowering informed decision-making and resilience in crisis prediction and risk management.

## Mission
The mission is to craft functional digital tools and distribute them openly, facilitating the analysis of open-source data with transparency. The project aims to uphold the spirit of “open-source” in OSINT, ensuring accessibility and clarity in data usage. By democratizing access to these resources, decision-makers across sectors can make informed choices, enhancing their capacity for crisis management and resilience.
